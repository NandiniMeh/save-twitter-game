# save-twitter-game

On Monday evening, 4th October 2021, Facebook Instagram and Whatsapp went dark for over 6 hours. And ofcourse, as soon as it did, users started joking and sharing memes about it on the only social networking site that survived - Twitter.

Inspired by the plethora of memes on Instagram (which is now finally back up and running), I created a game called **save twitter!**
The goal of the game is to avoid bumping into a pesky loading sign, and preventing a crash!
